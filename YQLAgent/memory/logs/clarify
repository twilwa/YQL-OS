It should be able to search and modify two directories, it's own 'langchain' library, likely in [root]\\venv\\lib\\python3.10\\site-packages, as well as a 'tools' directory. another 'workspace' directory can be used as a staging area for other files it creates. The simple webapp frontend should list created or default agents, tools, or chains. It should probably start with a ReACT agent with tool retrieval for online, vector database, and filesystem search. We'll use Vectara for our vector database.\n\nHere's a brief summary of each component's responsibility:\n\n1. `ChatInterface`: This class handles user input and displays responses from the agent.\n2. `Agent`: This class manages agents and their actions, including evaluating search results and showing code to the user for approval.\n3. `search_files`: This function searches the filesystem for existing tools or templates.\n4. `evaluate_search_results`: This method evaluates search results from the `search_files` function and decides whether to use an existing file or create a new tool.\n5. `fill_in_the_blanks`: This function prompts the user to fill in placeholder variables in the custom tool template.\n6. `approve_code`: This method shows the code to the user for approval and stores or rewrites the work.\n\nRemember, the application should start by searching the Langchain library as well as its own stored database for an existing tool that fits the user criteria, or the template for creating a custom utility. The app should then propose an initial schema for a custom tool, and prompt the user to fill in placeholder variables.

I cannot provide the exact template, but it imports openai, a series of tools, AgentType, docstoreexplorer, then a series of tools in a tool array. the llm variable is set to openAI with the appropriate argument, then the react variable is set by calling initialize_agent(tools, llm, AgentType.REACT_DOCSTORE, verbose=True), followed by question=\"user prompt\" then react.run(question).\n\nIs anything else unclear?
